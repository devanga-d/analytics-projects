The dataset contains attributes of diamonds, including Carat, Cut, Color, Clarity, Depth, Table, and Price, used for regression analysis to determine factors influencing Log_price. 
The subset selection process, using forward, backward, and sequential replacement methods, identified Carat, I(Carat²), and quality factors (Cut, Color, Clarity) as the key predictors of diamond prices. 
Depth and Top_width_ratio were less consistently selected, suggesting limited influence. 
These results emphasize the critical role of Carat and the non-linear effect of I(Carat²) in determining diamond prices.
